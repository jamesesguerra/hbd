        message: 'hi babby, i wish you could understand how happy you make me. i know i always say it but it\'s the kind of happiness that makes me feel like a kid again. you help me realize that even though itâ€™s scary knowing we have only so much time in this world, we should still live in a way that chases love and wonder and curiosity, and not forget that the richest moments in life don\'t come from getting a promotion / raise. that after a long day of work and being stressed and worrying about countless things, i always have you to ground me, to remind me what really matters. ever since that day i finished reading a far wilder magic, i always knew you were the only person / thing that could get me back to being that 11 yr old boy who just wanted to play minecraft all day. i guess thats also why i associate so many minecraft things with you, cos you\'re my reminder that it\'s okay for even the most grown up of people to become kids again. and the happiness that brings me is something i\'d never trade for anything in the world',
