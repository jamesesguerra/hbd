        message: 'hi babby, i wish you could understand how happy you make me. i know i always say it but it\'s the kind of happiness that makes me feel like a kid again. you help me realize that even though it‚Äôs scary knowing we have only so much time in this world, we should still live in a way that chases love and wonder and curiosity, and not forget that the richest moments in life don\'t come from getting a promotion / raise. that after a long day of work and being stressed and worrying about countless things, i always have you to ground me, to remind me what really matters. ever since that day i finished reading a far wilder magic, i always knew you were the only person / thing that could get me back to being that 11 yr old boy who just wanted to play minecraft all day. i guess thats also why i associate so many minecraft things with you, cos you\'re my reminder that it\'s okay for even the most grown up of people to become kids again. and the happiness that brings me is something i\'d never trade for anything in the world',

        message: "hi my wifey, sorry baby i know waiting can feel long sometimes, i also cant wait. i often catch myself daydreaming about how fun life would be if we lived together na. i always look forward to waking up next to you, the shared routines, going out to eat whenever we feel like it, playing games / watching movies before bed, and of course getting to kiss you goodnight in real life instead of through the phone. but until then, please bare with me cos its almost naman na, and i want you to know ill always try my best to take you out. but i also want you to know that all this time we've been waiting isnt for nothing din, i think the life we‚Äôre building already started the day we met. cos i've learned so much from you and i continue to wanna be a better person every day cos of you, and i dont think i would be the husband you deserve if not for all this time we've spent together. so i just want to you to think of this time as just being better for each other and preparing so that when the day comes, we'll be the best version of ourselves. and when it finally does, i promise to love you even more than i already do now, for the rest of our lives",

        message: "hi baby, first off i just wanna say sorry for whatever we‚Äôre arguing about. especially if its something stupid i said again. throughout the time na wev'e been together i've learned to really think about what im about to say before saying it, and i think i've improved a lot already. but im sorry if i slipped up again, and i don't have any excuse for it. if u can, please allow me to fix and learn from it again, cos theres really nothing i wouldn't fix about myself for you. if it's something else, i hope we can understand where each of us is coming from. i don't think its bad to argue sometimes cos its an opportunity to learn from one another, and an opportunity to maybe change / improve something about ourselves. us being partners and soulmates doesn't mean that we'll never disagree naman, think it just means we're committed enough to be honest and speak up, knowing that whatever we‚Äôll say wont break us apart. i just want us to always remember that we‚Äôre on the same team and we care enough to fight for each other and not against each other. so even if we disagree sometimes, or my words dont come out right, please remember that i love and care about you more than anything / anyone else, and i'll continue to choose to fix things no matter what it is",
