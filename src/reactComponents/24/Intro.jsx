        <p>happy 24th birthday my babsy ü§ç i'm so lucky to have spent another year filled with happy memories with you</p>

        <br />

        <p>starting our pokemon addiction is definitely one of my favorites this year. funny how i thought it was weird when my ate first mentioned it, yet we ended up spending so much more than her paüòÄ going to pokemon events hunting down our prios was so so fun, and then arranging and looking at our binders was just the icing on the cake. i love how we still bond over tcg pocket every day. i know we'll get into it more again when we have more money na</p>

        <br />

        <p>you brought me to my first concert and it was one of the happiest days of my life. i'm so glad i got to experience that first with you, tas with keshi pa. singing soft spot with keshi live, while holding your hand and kissing you, felt like the best bday gift you could ever give me. i can't wait for our next concert together (sana wala nang epal sa tabi ko)</p>

        <br />

        <p>
          then came one of the most emotional and meaningful days for both of us - march 14. i got my raise and the only thing i wanted to do in that moment was call you. you're the reason i was able to where i am  today and why i just keep pushing forward. that was also the day the final ruling came out for the annulment, something i know meant so much to you and your family. im so grateful that i was there with you and your family when your dad proposed to your mom na, and i can't wait for their wedding
        </p>

        <br />
        <p>thank you again for another year of being the best girlfriend baby. i appreciate so much of who you are, you continue to amaze me every day. it's been how many years na and i still can't believe you're my girlfriendüòÄ i already can't wait for another year of planning our fits and going out on dates, shopping together, watching movies, eating (with less sugar), and just living life with my best friend. i love you always and forever</p>
